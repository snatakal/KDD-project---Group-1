### Project Description:
#### Introduction
League of Legends commonly referred to as League is a highly popular Multiplayer online battle arena game.
The game anually hosts the League World Championship, which has one of the larest prize pools in e-sports. As such there are high stakes involved for the participating teams, sponsors of teams, and the viewers. Teams spend a lot of time in analyzing different team compositions, matchups, and strategies in order to maximize their chances of winning each match.

Every match of League has many factors that affect the outcome of the match. Some examples of these factors are are: the playable character (champion) being played, the number of enemy kills a player had, the amount of gold a player earned, etc.
Data Analytics is used to understand the relationships between these factors, so that teams can prioritize and adapt to the differnt changes that each match brings about. 

#### Research Question
In this project we look to uncover some of the in-game factors that affect the outcome of a match, and find the trends and relationsips between these factors that are not visible in raw match statistics.

#### Data
The primary data source for this project is a large data set of 1v1 matchup information of players playing League at the Master rank level.
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jasperan/league-of-legends-1v1-matchups-results) was obtained from Kaggle. 
Additional game data will be obtained from League servers using the Riot Games [API](https://developer.riotgames.com/)

### CRISP-DM Process:
We have undergone these steps as a part of CRISP-DM:
1) Research Phase

### Future Work
This project focuses on identifying trends in the game using data from past matches. The findings of this analysis can be used to develop applications for live game analytics.
